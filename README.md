This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in C#.

## Introduction

## Installation

1. Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Compile the project using the following command:
5. Run the compiled application.

## Features

- Grid-based gameplay.
- Snake movement in four directions (up, down, left, right).
- Collision detection with walls and the snake's body.
- Food generation and consumption.
- Score tracking.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
- The snake will continuously move in the direction it's facing.
- Eat food (denoted by a symbol) to grow the snake's length and earn points.
- Avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.
- The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.
- Try to achieve the highest score possible!
